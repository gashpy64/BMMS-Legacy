# BMMS database scripts

## Always test on a copy first

Every change goes to a test copy before it goes to `BMMS`:

1. Restore the latest `BMMS` backup as a second database named `BMMS_bak1` (SSMS: Restore Database, change the database name and the two file names). Never restore over `BMMS` for a test.
2. Run the scripts and the tests on `BMMS_bak1`. Every test must show PASS (or SKIPPED) before going on.
3. Back up `BMMS`:
   `BACKUP DATABASE BMMS TO DISK = N'C:\Backups\BMMS_before_change.bak' WITH COPY_ONLY;`
4. Run the same scripts on `BMMS`, in the same order, then the tests that are allowed on `BMMS`.

Scripts 1 to 9 and the two older test scripts start with `USE [BMMS]`. To run one of them on the test copy, change that first line to `USE [BMMS_bak1]` in the SSMS window before running it, and do not save the change.

Scripts 10 to 13 and the five new test scripts have **no `USE` line**. They run in the database selected in the SSMS toolbar, print its name, and stop without changing anything if the name does not start with `BMMS`.

## Run order

On a database that does not have the changes yet:

1. BMMS-Fix-Login-Procedures.sql          (login lookup split; needed by the new password hashing)
2. BMMS-Fix-Delete-Procedures.sql         (delete procedures with reference checks)
3. BMMS-Fix-ResetDatabase-Seeds.sql       (Reset Database seeds the 4 default users with hashed passwords and ManagerId NULL for "no manager"; installs the procedure only, does not reset)
4. BMMS-Add-PrimaryKeys.sql
5. BMMS-Add-ForeignKeys-Safe.sql          (FK_Agenda_Committee, FK_Attendance_Committee)
6. BMMS-Fix-FK-Procedures.sql             (7 procedures changed so the next 4 keys can be added; needs the MemberDB.cs NULL-state fix deployed)
7. BMMS-Add-ForeignKeys-Step3.sql         (FK_Action_Item_Minutes, FK_ActionItem_User_Map_Users, FK_Meeting_Chairman, FK_Member_State_Master)
8. BMMS-Fix-MinutesFinalize-Procedure.sql (minutes finalization no longer duplicates action items or maps users to other meetings' items)
9. BMMS-Add-ForeignKeys-Step4.sql         (FK_Users_ManagerId; run after the build that stores "no manager" as NULL is deployed, and after re-running step 3 if it was applied before this change - the script refuses otherwise)
10. BMMS-Fix-UserDelete-Procedure.sql     (a user with history cannot be deleted; replaces the version of spr_DeleteUserByUserId installed by steps 2 and 6, so always run it after them)
11. BMMS-Add-ForeignKeys-Step5.sql        (21 keys from the user-id columns to Users; refuses until step 10 is installed, and refuses any key whose column holds an unknown user)
12. BMMS-Fix-Attendance-FutureMeeting.sql (attendance only for a meeting dated today or earlier, by the database server date; run BEFORE deploying the build that reads its Result)
13. BMMS-Fix-UserProtection-Stage1.sql    (who may change which user account; replaces spr_DeleteUserByUserId of step 10, spr_AddEditUser and spr_ResetPasswordByUserId; run after step 10 and BEFORE deploying the build that reads Reason)

Steps 1 to 9 are already applied to the local `BMMS` and to `BMMS_bak1`. Steps 10 and 11 are applied to `BMMS_bak1` only. Step 12 is applied to `BMMS_bak1`, `BMMS` and `BMMS_Test`. Steps 10, 11 and 13 are also on `BMMS_Test`; step 13 is NOT on `BMMS`.
Re-running the fix scripts is safe; re-running the key scripts reports that the constraint already exists.
If step 2, 6 or 10 is ever re-run, run step 13 again afterwards: each contains an older spr_DeleteUserByUserId (and step 10 needs steps 2 and 6 to be followed by it as before).

## Steps 10 and 11: what to run where

On `BMMS_bak1` (test copy):

1. BMMS-Fix-UserDelete-Procedure.sql
2. BMMS-Add-ForeignKeys-Step5.sql         (expect "Added now: 21   Refused: 0", or "already exists" on a re-run)
3. BMMS-Test-UserDelete.sql               (75 checks)
4. BMMS-Test-UserKey-Workflows.sql        (23 checks)
5. BMMS-Test-FK-Procedures.sql            (19 checks; change the `USE` line)
6. BMMS-Test-ResetDatabase.sql            (14 checks; test copy ONLY)
7. The manual checklist below, with the application pointed at the test copy (optional but recommended)

Then on `BMMS`, after the backup:

1. BMMS-Fix-UserDelete-Procedure.sql
2. BMMS-Add-ForeignKeys-Step5.sql
3. BMMS-Test-UserDelete.sql
4. BMMS-Test-UserKey-Workflows.sql
5. BMMS-Test-FK-Procedures.sql

Do NOT run BMMS-Test-ResetDatabase.sql on `BMMS`. It refuses to, by name.

## Test and check scripts

- BMMS-Check-Orphans.sql                  (read-only check of candidate foreign keys, and of every user-id column)
- BMMS-Test-Delete-Procedures.sql         (delete-procedure tests for the master tables; deletes real unreferenced rows, inside a transaction that is rolled back)
- BMMS-Test-FK-Procedures.sql             (tests for steps 6 to 9; rolled back)
- BMMS-Test-UserDelete.sql                (tests for steps 10 and 11: user delete rules, one test per protected column, one per key; rolled back)
- BMMS-Test-UserKey-Workflows.sql         (committee, meeting, agenda, approvals, finalize, confirm, alerts, login / backup / mail audit, through the real procedures; rolled back)
- BMMS-Test-ResetDatabase.sql             (runs spr_sys_ResetDatabase with all keys in place; TEST COPY ONLY; rolled back, and the identity counters are put back)
- BMMS-Test-Attendance-FutureMeeting.sql  (tests for step 12: past / today / future / no-date meetings, new attendance and edits; 23 checks; run on the test copy; rolled back)
- BMMS-Test-UserProtection-Stage1.sql     (tests for step 13: every action by Admin / Controller / other roles, own account, last active Admin / Controller, acting user missing, reasons 5, 6 and 9, re-raised errors, list flags, locks; 142 checks; test copy only; rolled back)

Since step 13 the four older user tests (UserDelete, UserKey-Workflows, FK-Procedures, ResetDatabase) pass an acting Admin to the user procedures and read the extra Reason / ReasonDetail columns. Run them only after step 13.

The rolled-back tests keep no data, but identity values (UserId and so on) skip a few numbers each time they run.

## User delete rule (step 10)

A user cannot be deleted (the page shows the existing "in use" message) if their id is in any of these:

- other users: ManagerId, CreatedBy, UpdatedBy
- Agenda, Meeting, Minutes, Committee, Committee_Member, Meeting_Member, Member: CreatedBy, UpdatedBy (Agenda also MgrApprovedBy, ControllerApprovedBy)
- Attendance.UpdatedBy, Action_Item.UpdatedBy
- Alert_Master.CreatedBy (alerts the user raised)
- Audit_Trail_Master, Audit_Trail_SendMail, Audit_Trail_SqlBackup, Audit_Trial_Login (the user has logged in)
- Department, Designation, Roles, Alert_Type, Decision_Type, Member_Type, Subject_Type: CreatedBy, UpdatedBy

Removed together with the user, without blocking: alerts received (Alert_User_Map) and action-item read flags (ActionItem_User_Map).

Mail and login audit rows dated before the user was created do not block: they belong to an earlier user who had the same id.

## Step 12: attendance for a future meeting (what to run where)

On `BMMS_bak1`: BMMS-Fix-Attendance-FutureMeeting.sql, then BMMS-Test-Attendance-FutureMeeting.sql (23 checks, all PASS).
On `BMMS`, after the backup: BMMS-Fix-Attendance-FutureMeeting.sql only.

Rule: attendance (new or edited, chairman included) is saved only when `CAST(MeetingDate AS date) <= CAST(GETDATE() AS date)` on the database server. A meeting today is allowed at any time of day; a meeting with no date is refused. The page shows "Attendance cannot be marked for a meeting that has not yet taken place." Existing attendance rows are not changed.

Any database the application points at must have step 12 before the new build runs there, otherwise saving attendance stops with an error that names this script.

## Step 13: user account protection, stage 1 (what to run where)

On the test copies (`BMMS_bak1`, `BMMS_Test`): BMMS-Fix-UserProtection-Stage1.sql, then BMMS-Test-UserProtection-Stage1.sql (142 checks), then the four older user tests.
Not yet on `BMMS`. On `BMMS` it needs steps 10 and 11 first (they are not there either).

Rules (dbo.fn_UserChangeRefusal):

- Nobody can delete, deactivate or change the role of their own account. Editing your own details and password is allowed.
- The last ACTIVE Admin and the last ACTIVE Controller cannot be deleted, deactivated or given another role.
- Admin: any user. Controller: any user except Admin and Controller users, for every action (edit details, role, reset password, delete, deactivate); cannot create or promote to Admin / Controller. Other roles: only their own details and password.
- The acting user must be given: NULL, 0 or an unknown id is refused (Reason 8).

Every protected procedure returns one row `Result, Reason, ReasonDetail`. Result 1 = done, 0 = refused. Reason: 0 done, 1 own account, 2 last active Admin, 3 last active Controller, 4 not allowed for your role, 5 other users point at the user (names), 6 history (groups), 7 reserved (stage 3), 8 acting user missing, 9 a database reference the checks do not know. For Reason 9 the page shows a plain sentence and writes the SQL Server message to the application error log (`BMMS\Log\yyyy_MM_dd_ErrorLog.txt`). Any other database error is re-raised and reaches the error page; it is never reported as "in use".

Rule 2 is checked inside the same transaction as the change, with UPDLOCK, HOLDLOCK on the active Admin / Controller rows, so two simultaneous changes run one after the other and the second sees the first.

spr_SetUserStatusByUserId (deactivate / activate) exists and is tested, but no page calls it until stage 2.

## Manual checklist (application pointed at the test copy)

Do these after steps 10 and 11, logged in as the role shown. Each should work exactly as before.

1. Admin: add a user, then delete it straight away. Expected: deleted.
2. Admin: delete a user who has logged in or created anything. Expected: the "in use" message, user still listed.
3. Controller: add a committee, add a meeting, tag a committee member and a meeting member.
4. User: add an agenda for that meeting. Manager: the alert appears on the dashboard; approve it. Controller: approve it.
5. Controller: finalize the agenda, update the minutes (one item as Followup), finalize the minutes, confirm the minutes.
6. Controller: mark attendance for the meeting.
7. Any user: open the dashboard alerts and mark one as read; open an action item.
8. Any user: change password; log out and log in again.
9. Admin: Reset Password for another user.
10. Admin: Backup Database (a row appears in the backup audit report).
11. Controller: send a notice or agenda mail (needs SMTP; otherwise skip).
12. Admin: edit a department, designation, member type, subject type and decision type.

## Known defects (logged, not fixed)

- spr_AgendaFinalizeByMeetingId and spr_AddEditAgendaByController insert Minutes rows with CreatedBy = 1 and UpdatedBy = 1 hard-coded. User 1 does not exist in the live data. Because of this Minutes.CreatedBy and Minutes.UpdatedBy have no key.
- Audit_Trail_SendMail and Audit_Trial_Login hold ids of users deleted long ago, and the Users identity counter is now handing some of those ids to new users. Reports that show "sent by" or "logged in" by user id can show the wrong name for those old rows.
