## Test database

[[CONFIRM: not written yet (WF2b2)]]
[[CONFIRM: lead from old Architecture notes: database tests run on a test copy (BMMS_Test or BMMS_bak1), never first on BMMS]]

## Test scripts and how to run them

[[CONFIRM: not written yet (WF2b2)]]
[[CONFIRM: lead from old Architecture notes: every step has a test script that runs inside a transaction and rolls back]]

### Step 40 (RA1a): role access

Database/BMMS-Test-RoleAccess-Step40.sql (BMMS_Test only; refuses the name BMMS; stops when step 40 is
not installed). Part 1 reads the markers of step 40 and the older markers (steps 13, 14, 18, 21), the
parameters and that no THROW is left in the two member type procedures. Part 2 runs in one transaction
that is rolled back, with made-up users, a department and a member type (ZZ40...): a Controller is
refused (Reason 4) on Create, Edit, RoleChange, Deactivate, Activate, Delete and ResetPassword of another
account, and may Edit and ResetPassword its own; the Reason 1, 7 and 8 cases stay; an Admin may do all
of it; a Manager is refused as before; the user procedures and the User Master list flags end to end;
the member type Save and Delete (Controller refused, Admin allowed); nothing left after the rollback and
every identity counter put back. Result on BMMS_Test (owner's run for RA1a): 43 of 43 PASS.

Older Test scripts changed for step 40: only their Controller expectations (each changed line carries a
"Step 40 (RA1a)" comment). After step 40 they pass on BMMS_Test; on a database without step 40 those
cases fail.

| Script | Result with step 40 | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| BMMS-Test-UserProtection-Stage1.sql | 142 PASS | The Controller acting on a Manager, User, Management or MD Secretariat user, and creating a Manager, User, Management or MD Secretariat user: Reason 4 instead of 0; spr_CheckUserChange, Controller resets a User's password: Reason 4; the list flags of the MD Secretariat row for a Controller: 0 0 0 |
| BMMS-Test-UserStatus-Stage2a.sql | 50 PASS | The Controller deactivates or activates a User: Reason 4; the list flag CanDeactivate of a User row for a Controller: 0 |
| BMMS-Test-MemberTypes-Step21.sql | 100 PASS | The Controller's save, edit and delete of a member type: Reason 4. The display order case of reserved type 3 now acts as the Admin and keeps its result (Reason 7), renamed "by an Admin"; two setup lines (no check row) have the Admin save and edit the types the later cases use |

The other user and member type Test scripts are unchanged and PASS. The Rollback script restores the earlier
texts; BMMS-Check-InstalledSteps.sql shows step 40 Installed, 3 of 3.
